      "title": "How to Install a DIY Stair Runner",
      "content": "This project is really simple and only took a few hours to install. Stairs take a beating. Especially if you have kids and pets. I ultimately chose an indoor/outdoor rug made out of Polypropylene. Another popular choice for stairs is wool. <br><b>Supplies: </b><br> - Stair Runners (I used 4, but you will need to measure your stairs) <br> - Carpet Padding <br> - Fabric <br> - Scissors <br> - Crown Staple Gun <br> - 1/2″ Staples & 1″ Staples <br> - Carpet Tucker z,brz. - Pencil <br> - Tape Measure <br> Before you begin installing the stair runner, the very first thing you need to do is clean your stairs. Next I went down every single step and marked the center with some painter’s tape. To measure and cut for the padding I first measured the width of my actual carpet runner. I wanted the padding to be about 2″ less wide than the rug (1″ on each side). This allows the rug to be stapled down and ensure there’s no padding sticking out. Once measurements have been determined cut those out of your carpet pad and begin centering them up and stapling them to the steps with the 1/2″ staples. Installing the stair runner comes next. I placed this under the lip of the floor (on the first riser) and begin stapling across the top. Once you have that top edge stapled in place you will pull the runner out and use the carpet tucker to get it down into the corner as tight as you possible can. Once you have stapled along the back corner to secure it, go back up to the step you just completed and staple along the finished edges of the rug to make sure the sides can’t move around.",

      "content": "What you need: <br>–Canvas or Wood piece to do the art on <br>–Paint in whatever colors you choose. I used these by DecoArt’s line Americana <br>–DecoArt Texture Thick and or Modeling Paste (I used a bit of each) <br>–Texture Tools (you can buy the plastic pieces or some random things from around the house) <br>1. Take your canvas, wood, etc. and smear on the texture pastes as you like. I used the groovy ends of my texture tools and just went crazy with it all to have a messy look. <br>2. Let it dry completely. This might take a bit. <br>3. Time to paint! I squirted some paint on the canvas. Then I used the flat end of a texture tool to smear it all around. I of course kept adding paint until I was satisfied. I used the tool to smear paint on the sides of the canvas as well. Note: I did try paint brushes, but it didn’t give it enough of the texture look because it filled inbetween the bottom texture layer making flatter. <br>4. Let it dry. All done.",
